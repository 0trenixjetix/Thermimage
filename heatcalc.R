# What is needed to start estimating heat loss

# Definitely required ####
# Surface temperatures, Ts (oC)
# Ambient temperatures, Ta (oC)
# Characteristic dimension, L (m)
# Area, A (m^2)

# Required if working outdoors with solar radiation ####
# Surface visual reflectance, rho, which could be measured or estimated
# Solar radiation, W/m2

# Can be estimated or provided ####
# Wind speed, V (m/s)
# Ground Temperature, Tg  (oC) - estimated from air temperature if not provided
# Incoming infrared radiation, Ld (will be estimated from Air Temperature)
# Incoming infrared radiation, Lu (will be estimated from Ground Temperature)
